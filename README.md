# Advent Translation - Version 0

## About

This is a project, modeled after [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), providing 25 days of translation practice from Hebrew and Greek verses in the Bible. It is currently in the planning and prototyping stages.

As version 0, this is for prototyping and proof-of-concept.

It last iteration of this project was too ambitious. I tried to learn and use too many new technologies all at once. So I'm prototyping here with tried and true tools and can develop with newer tech in later versions.

## Technologies

Familiar to me includes:

- React
- MongoDB (or maybe not, if I go with PocketBase)
- Node.js
- Express

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
